improvements:
There are several ways to optimize Redis performance, especially when it comes to write-heavy loads. Here are some strategies that can be applied to your code:

Pipelining: Instead of sending each command to Redis separately, you can pipeline your commands. Pipelining batches multiple commands to be sent to the server in one go, reducing the round-trip time (RTT) overhead.

Use Multi/Exec with Caution: While transactions using MULTI/EXEC blocks ensure atomicity, they might not necessarily lead to performance improvements due to the locking they entail. If atomicity is not a requirement for your increments and sets, avoid using MULTI/EXEC blocks.

Connection Overhead: Ensure that your use of jedisPool.getResource() is not causing connection overhead. Reusing the Jedis connection within each thread rather than getting a new one for each operation can reduce overhead.

Avoid Selecting Database Index Repeatedly: If you're only using one Redis database index across your application, there's no need to call jedis.select(DB_INDEX) every time you fetch a Jedis resource. You could set the default database in the JedisPoolConfig if it's not the default (DB 0).

Reduce Logging: Excessive logging can slow down your application, especially if itâ€™s I/O-bound. Consider reducing the amount of logging, particularly within the tight loop of database operations, or using asynchronous logging.

Optimize Data Structures: Make sure that the Redis data structures you're using are the most efficient for your use case. For example, using sorted sets (ZSETs) for leaderboards, sets (SETs) for unique collections, and hashes (HASHes) for object representations can be very efficient.

Review Data Model: Reassess your data model and ensure that it's optimized for your access patterns. Sometimes restructuring how data is stored in Redis can lead to performance gains.

Fine-tune JedisPoolConfig: Adjust the pool configuration for optimal performance based on your use case. This includes settings like maxTotal, maxIdle, minIdle, and so on.

Concurrency: Be cautious with the number of threads in your thread pool. While it may seem that more threads could mean more throughput, it could also lead to contention and reduced performance. Tune this number based on your system's capabilities.

Monitor Performance: Use Redis's monitoring tools to understand your bottleneck. The MONITOR command and Redis slow logs can be particularly useful.

Redis Server Performance: Make sure the Redis server is properly tuned. Look at the maxclients setting, and ensure that the server is not swapping by configuring vm.overcommit_memory and transparent_hugepage settings on the machine hosting Redis.

Hardware: Ultimately, the write performance might be limited by the hardware Redis is running on. Faster CPUs, more memory, or faster disks (if persistence is enabled) can help.

Data Serialization: If you're storing complex structures, the method of serialization can impact performance. Ensure that serialization is efficient and consider alternatives like Protocol Buffers if you're currently using JSON or XML.

Redis Version: Make sure you are using an up-to-date version of Redis, as performance improvements are made in each version.
